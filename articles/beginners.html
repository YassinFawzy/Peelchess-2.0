                <h1>A Chess Guide For Beginners</h1>
    
                <p>This guide is made for beginners and novice players to get
                    started
                    with chess. Nevertheless, let's get into it! Check out the role
                    of
                    each piece here: <a

                <h2>Core Opening Principles Of Chess:</h2>
    
                <p>The Core Opening Principles of Chess are to:</p>
    
                <ul>
                    <li>Control the center.</li>
                    <li>Develop your pieces as quickly as you can.</li>
                    <li>Castle as early as you can.</li>
                </ul>
    
                <p>Sounds simple right? Let's get into it!</p>
    
                <h3>Controlling the center:</h3>
    
                <img src="https://i.redd.it/36ph5ax2tla81.png"
                    alt="Control the center example">
    
                <p>It is important for us to control the center. Sure, you can
                    succeed
                    from the sides but it is much more difficult. We need to work on
                    the
                    very basics of chess, and fighting for central control is
                    crucial.
                    <br><br>Control of the center means your pieces are in more
                    active
                    locations, they exert more influence over the board and the
                    Knight,
                    in particular, literally has more places he can attack from the
                    center of the board.
                    <br><br>
                    Controlling the center is vitally important for us beginners to
                    do.
    
                </p>
    
                <h3>Develop your pieces:</h3>
    
                <img
                    src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/PafziElr-CgIxDZ9hGqFZXQ3WJKYspi4kAejFKyL35e8uga5Ll9R0sIcBXhhvFCNP7HllSoRB7RWGLO0a-hYy57KnKBNs4uHZJNxB-NzfrXXdIwOaqs7LWKzfe2L0ryLhMD0P7v3oPnR23YbXu7SYts"
                    alt="Develop your pieces example">
    
                <p>Speeding up the advancement of our chess pieces is another
                    crucial
                    principle. Note that we're not focusing on Pawns in this
                    discussion.
                    Our primary focus should lie in swiftly developing Knights,
                    Bishops,
                    Rooks, and the Queen. These pieces can be categorized into major
                    (Rooks and Queen) and minor pieces (Knights and Bishops).
                    To "develop our pieces", means getting our Knights, Bishops,
                    Rooks,
                    and the Queen actively involved in the game.
                    <br><br>
                    However, this concept of development goes beyond mere movement
                    for
                    the sake of it. It's essential to develop strategically, which
                    involves advancing our pieces in ways that exert pressure on the
                    opponent's pieces. When advancing your pieces, always bear in
                    mind
                    that each move should have a purpose.
                    <br><br>
                    Think of purposeful development as gaining an extra move against
                    opponents who fail to develop strategically. By deploying a
                    piece
                    with intent and having it simultaneously target an opponent's
                    piece,
                    you effectively gain an advantage against those who are not
                    making
                    strategic progress.
                </p>
    
                <h4>Three tips for developing your pieces:</h4>
    
                <ul>
                    <li>Don’t move your Queen too early.</li>
                    <li>Develop the side you want to castle first.</li>
                    <li>Don’t move the same piece multiple times.</li>
                </ul>
    
                <p>These are general guidelines for beginners, though there might be
                    exceptions. They encourage solid progress and a broader
                    understanding of the game.
                </p>
    
                <h3>Bishops And Knights</h3>
    
                <p>Despite sharing a material value of 3 points each, Bishops and
                    Knights diverge greatly in function. Bishops excel in openness,
                    utilizing their long-range prowess to target distant pieces and
                    pose
                    threats from a distance. Conversely, Knights thrive in closed
                    positions, traversing over obstacles with ease.
                    <br><br>
                    Thus, premature exchanges of Bishops or Knights are ill-advised.
                    Optimal outcomes stem from aligning the piece choice with the
                    positional context. While not universally applicable, the
                    principle
                    of Bishops excelling in open positions and Knights in closed
                    holds.
                    Avoiding untimely piece swaps prevents disadvantageous setups.
                    <br><br>
                    Possessing both Bishops holds potential in maximizing board
                    coverage. Their unique attributes provide a strategic edge,
                    reinforcing the significance of choosing wisely.
                </p>
    
                <h3>Castling:</h3>
    
                <img
                    src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/rRNLxrhxHGbgnV3KnuIpM52BNOX28UA3sxuxju0l2_IA-hHZCY1Q9iPpx7Vt-fZ_l1WWmZLx8VLrcp2zm0zXhimSQNa87xN5_3YShk74YPtAxrcjlapfxnHNLBgomhyCLlcbTTayxmMOi5K1cf25tAs"
                    alt="Castling example">
    
                <p>It's a crucial principle. Early castling secures the King and
                    activates a Rook...</p>
    
                <p>Note: Castling is not possible if:</p>
    
                <ul>
                    <li>The King is in check</li>
                    <li>The King passes through check</li>
                    <li>The King ends up in check</li>
                    <li>The King has already moved</li>
                    <li>The Rook that is used has moved</li>
                </ul>
    
                <p>Despite drawbacks (including checkmate if you are careless),
                    early
                    castling is vital for King's safety and practice. It refines
                    skill
                    and supports King safety. Castling can lead to checkmate; learn
                    and
                    improve. Analyze games for quicker development and center
                    control.
                    Foresight grows with time, but novices, prioritize castling.
                </p>
    
                <h3>Castled and Uncastled Kings:</h3>
    
                <p>If your opponent avoids castling or delays it, the strategy is to
                    open up the board to expose their uncastled king at the center.
                    This
                    involves trading pawns to achieve this goal. Don't shy away from
                    pawn trades as they can lead to a favorable position against an
                    opponent with an uncastled king. If your opponent weakens their
                    position, consider sacrificing pieces to exploit this and
                    further
                    open up the position for a king attack.
    
                    <br><br>
                    When both sides castle on opposite flanks, it's advisable to
                    open up
                    files and push pawns against the opponent's king (known as a
                    Pawn
                    Storm). This strategy capitalizes on attacking the opponent's
                    king
                    with numerous pieces while keeping your own king safe on the
                    opposite side.
                    <br><br>
                    For beginners, simply grasping the concept of advancing pawns to
                    target an opponent's uncastled king when castling differs will
                    yield
                    victories, as many opponents might not recognize this effective
                    tactic.
    
                </p>
    
                <h3>Undefended Pieces</h3>
    
                <img
                    src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xpQjmGwmNtz0QqJb38OS9EoUuxWz01aoF_s9RGxoGCwL2cCsSKLqLWQKBjxU-4F9DBBSNt21g7go_QS4jqhWdx8HC87UbwLxjuSmufAySKHpVJG3iBcFJmlAvb1f_OmBMWHw2LMJ3XrxECTBgCsilsA"
                    alt="Undefended pieces example">
    
                <p>I’d like to expand a little on those core principles now, because
                    there are a few other little things to keep in mind.
                    <br><br>
                    The most important one, is to have as little undefended pieces
                    as
                    possible. At the beginner level, we often neglect to defend our
                    pieces, which leaves us vulnerable to opponents capitalizing on
                    these exposed positions resulting from inadequate development.
                    Unprotected pieces represent weaknesses in our chess strategy.
                    Exploiting these openings, opponents can gain an upper hand. By
                    ensuring the safeguarding of our pieces during development and
                    an
                    upper hand. By ensuring the safeguarding of our pieces during
                    development and movement, we can enhance our chances of winning.
                    <br><br>
                    When advancing your pieces, prioritize their protection. Prior
                    to
                    making a move, confirm that sufficient defenders are in place.
                    Our
                    goal is to minimize the creation of vulnerabilities.
                    <br><br>
                    Conversely, continuously assess if the opponent has any weak
                    points.
                    Are there undefended pieces? If yes, strategize ways to seize
                    them.
                </p>
    
                <h3>Opponent Mistakes:</h3>
    
                <img
                    src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/RmTRnnHNjQyb3VPrxVM5NkIPp_n7oJH9YFGUoTBLCeRkQoaYe3FFym6VNOfSIJhwSlQVEhqoLKEaRGfsxF6Dy3ahQbeuLjPF5N7cceO0m_GSZnciwYKi94B6xrnvggVP-gtnPzxRmfDCcOQ2jT72sW4"
                    alt="Opponent mistakes example">
    
                <p>Opponent’s errors generally fall into two types: tactical and
                    positional mistakes. Positional errors are complex, while
                    tactical
                    blunders are more straightforward. To spot your opponent's
                    tactical
                    mistakes, pause after their move and check for material losses.
                    If
                    they blunder (a mess up or mistake), calculate if you can safely
                    capture it – beware of traps. Take the opportunity if viable.
                    <br><br>
                    Leveraging opponent blunders is potent for beginners and works
                    against skilled players. Even minor oversights grant advantages,
                    useful for piece trades when they lack material. Victory depends
                    on
                    minimizing errors and exploiting theirs, not just strategy or
                    tactics.
                    <br><br>
                    Novices often lose due to incomplete piece development, leaving
                    vulnerabilities, and not capitalizing on opponent mistakes. So,
                    act
                    swiftly upon identifying a mistake.
                    <br><br>
                    One blunder turns an even game into one-sided, seizing
                    advantages.
                    Yet, opponents can rectify mistakes swiftly if not acted upon
                    promptly.
    
                </p>
    
                <h3>Exchanging/Trading Pieces:</h3>
    
                <p>If you are down on material, the general advice is to not trade
                    pieces. If you are up on material, the general advice is to
                    trade
                    some pieces off to simplify the position</p>
    
                <p>Some extra things to keep in mind here though are, if you are
                    attacking the opponent and you have the space advantage, then do
                    not
                    trade pieces - keep your extra firepower on the board and go for
                    a
                    checkmate instead of simplifying to an end-game that might not
                    be
                    necessary.
                    <br><br>
                    If you are lacking space and are defending against the opponents
                    attacks, then it is better to look to exchange pieces to open
                    the
                    position up and also remove some of the opponent's attacking
                    pieces.
